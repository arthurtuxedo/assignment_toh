# Towers of Hanoi
# We have 3 rings and 3 discs of increasing size
# We need a method of moving the top-most disc to another ring that does not
#   already have a smaller ring on top.
# We need to keep track of where each disc is and / or the disc configuration
#   of each ring. The rings can have 3 possible size values on the bottom stack,
#   2 on the middle, and only 1 on top.
# We must make sure that the user enters an integer between 1 and 3 on the from
#   and to inputs.
# We must render some kind of visual representation after each move.
